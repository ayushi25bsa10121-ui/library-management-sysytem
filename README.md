# library-management-sysytem
A simple Library Management System (LMS) to help students and librarians manage books, issue/return operations, and view inventory. This CLI-based Python application allows adding books, searching, issuing books to users, returning books, and generating simple reports. Data is stored in JSON files so no database setup is required.
